Hi there! 👋

I'm Saswata Mukherjee, a Senior Software Engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), currently based in London, UK. 🇬🇧

As a member of the Multi-cluster Observability team (RHOBS) at Red Hat, I work on monitoring related technologies for building and running distributed observabiliy platforms at global scale on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)/[OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift).

Currently, I help maintain several open-source projects like [Thanos](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/maintainers.md/#core-maintainers-of-this-repository), which is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) incubating project for distributed scalable monitoring, and [Perses](https://perses.dev/), which is a observability vizualization toolkit (I maintain Go-based [community-mixins](https://github.com/perses/community-mixins) for the same). Also, am a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/governance/#team-members) team member and help maintain other tools & libraries within the community such as [mdox](https://github.com/bwplotka/mdox), [avalanche](https://github.com/prometheus-community/avalanche), [efficientgo/e2e](https://github.com/efficientgo/e2e), [observatorium](https://github.com/observatorium/api) and more!

Started my career as a [Google Summer of Code 2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/5145457193385984) mentee under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (Thanos project), so I also actively mentor Thanos and Prometheus [LFX projects](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/mentor/4bae0944-b520-4b17-ae27-910894932998) from time to time, to help the next generation of developers get more involved in OSS. I'm incredibly grateful to the people who helped me reach where I am, so I feel the need to do the same! 🌱

Interested in all things related to Go, Observability, K8s, SRE, Distributed Systems and Open Source.

Outside of professional pursuits, I love doing photography (digital & film), and discussing about old and new camera gear! 🎞️ 📷

## Feedback

Got any thoughts on work I'm doing in OSS, what I said in a talk or anything else? Would love to hear them, as I'm always open to learning via feedback! 🙂
